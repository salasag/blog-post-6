### Art Piece 1

David Cool created a very interesting piece to explore his connection to Bhutan and other influences. His piece is different as it combines something mystical with the arrangement of the eyes across the room as well as the time lapse of the sun in the center. While this is not personally my style I still found the piece fascinating in how it combined such a wide array of subjects.

### Art Piece 2

Art Com Studios a very neat piece here which takes in the kinetic energy of cars passing by and transforms it into light energy in the seven LED steles. The piece reads the kinetic energy of each car separately and sums it to get the result which leads to the work being more active during high traffic hours. I really like the simplicity of the piece and warm colors used which seem to match the lights of the passing cars.
